# Code versioning

This file will explain the procedure to follow when updating the version.

As we adhere to the [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model, we will want to create a `release/{NEXT_RELEASE}` branch from the `dev` branch each time we're going to deploy a new release. This branch will later be merged into `master` and `dev`.

The steps are as follows:

1. Make sure the `dev` branch has all the changes that you want to appear in the next version.
2. Decide what version your new release should be. We adhere strictly to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)! **Let's say you decide to update to version 1.2.3.**
3. Add the changes to [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).
4. Create the branch `release/1.2.3` from dev using

   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/1.2.3
   ```

5. Run the script [bumpversion.sh](../bumpversion.sh) using

   ```bash
   sh bumpversion.sh [version type]
   ```

   This script takes a single optional argument specifying the version type, one of

   - `--patch`
   - `--minor`
   - `--major`

   to bump the version to the next patch, minor version or major version. See [semantic versioning](<[se](https://semver.org/)>) for more information.

   > For our example, supposing we were on release `1.2.2`, we would need to call

   ```bash
   sh bumpversion.sh --patch
   ```

   to bump the version to `1.2.3`.

   > It's purpose is to bump the version number in the `pubspec.yaml` file, create the `version.txt` file used by the Github Actions workflow, create a commit with message `Bump version to 1.2.3` and tag the commit.

6. Merge the `release/1.2.3` back into `master` and `dev` using

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge release/1.2.3 --no-ff
   git checkout dev
   git merge release/1.2.3 --no-ff
   ```

   _Note the `--no-ff` flag. It is important._

7. You can now safely delete the `release/1.2.3` branch.

   ```bash
   git branch -d release/1.2.3
   ```
